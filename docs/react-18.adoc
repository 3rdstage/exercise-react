== Concepts

=== JSX

* React JSX is an extension to JavaScript. It allows writing a JavaScript code that looks like an HTML code.
* JSX supports expression in pure JavaScript syntax. Expression has to be enclosed inside the curly braces, `{` `}`. Expression can contain all variables available in the context, where the JSX is defined.
* It's important to distinguish between setting native HTML attributes, and setting custom React component props.
* Event handlers must be camelCased : `onClick`, `onKeyDown`
* JSX supports expression to be specified inside the attributes. In attributes, **double quote should not be used** along with expression.

[source, javascript]
....
const element = <h1>Hello React!</h1>

<script type="text/babel">
  var cTime = new Date().toTimeString();
  ReactDOM.render(
    <div><p>The current time is {cTime}</p></div>,
    document.getElementById('react-app') );
</script>
....

[source, html]
----
<style>
   .red { color: red }
</style>

<script type="text/babel">
   function getCurrentTime() {
      return new Date().toTimeString();
   }
   var class_name = "red";
   ReactDOM.render(
      <div>
         <p>The current time is <span className={class_name}>{getCurrentTime()}</span></p>
      </div>,
      document.getElementById('react-app')
   );
</script>
----

=== Component

* React component is the building block of a React application.
* The primary job of a React component is to render its user interface and update it whenever its internal state is changed.
** Initial rendering
** Event handling
** User interface updating

// https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-kroki?tab=readme-ov-file#usage
[plantuml,align=center,opts=inline]
....
@startuml

class Component
class FunctionComponent
class ClassComponent{
  render()
}
class NestedComponent

Component <|-- FunctionComponent
Component <|-- ClassComponent


@enduml
....

* Note that an element in React is not a component, but a component is comprised of multiple elements.
* Function components are very minimal in nature. Its only requirement is to return a React element.

[source, javascript]
----
// function component
function Hello(){
  return '<div>Hello</div>';
}

// class component
class HelloComponent extends React.Component{
  render(){
    return ( <div>Hello</div> );
  }
}
----

=== PropTypes

* React community provides a special package, `prop-types` to address the properties type mismatch problem.
* `prop-types` allows the properties of the component to be specified with type through a custom setting (propTypes) inside the component.

* Typescript : compile-time type checking
* prop-types : runtime type checking

[source, javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class FormattedMoney extends React.Component{

  constructor(props){
    super(props);

  }

  format(amount){
    return parseFloat(amount).toFixed(2);
  }

  render(){
    return(
      <span>{this.format(this.props.value)}</span>
    )
  }
}

FormattedMoney.PropTypes = {
  value: PropTypes.number.isRequired
}

=== Event Handler

* Typical Sample
.. Add a button with an onClick event
.. Set ``this.changeMessageHandler`` method as onClick event handler
.. Bind the event handler, `this.changeMessageHandler` in the constructor
.. Added the event handler and updated the state using `this.setState`.


=== Component Lifecycle

[cols="*", width=95%, options="header,autowidth"]
|===
^| Stage ^| Event Handler ^| Description ^| Remarks

.4+| Mounting | `constructor()`
| Invoked during the initial construction phase of the React component. Used to set initial **state** and **properties** of the component. |

| `getDerivedStateFromProps()` |   |

| `render()`
| Invoked after the construction of the component is completed. It renders the component in the virtual DOM instance. |

| `componentDidMount()`
| Invoked after the initial mounting of the component in the DOM tree. It is the good place to call API endpoints and to do network requests. |

.5+| Updating | `shouldComponentUpdate(__nextProps__, __nextState__)`
| Invoked during the update phase. Used to specify whether the component should update or not. |

| `getDerivedStateFromProps(__props__, __state__)`
| Invoked during both initial and update phase and just before the render() method. It returns the new state object. It is rarely used where the changes in properties results in state change. |

| `render()` |   |

| `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(__prevProps__, __prevState__)`
| Invoked just before the rendered content is committed to DOM tree. It is mainly used to get some information about the new content. |

| `componentDidUpdate(__prevProps__, __prevState__, __snapshot__)`
| Network request can be done during this phase but only when there is difference in component's current and previous properties. |

| Unmounting
| `componentWillUnmount()`
| Invoked after the component is unmounted from the DOM. This is the good place to clean up the object. |

|===

=== Typescript

* An empty interface, ``{}`` and ``Object`` all represent "any non-nullish value"—not "an empty object" as you might think. Using these types is a common source of misunderstanding and is not recommended.

=== Misc

* React toolchain will pre-process the css files ending with .module.css through CSS Module. Otherwise, it will be considered as a normal stylesheet.
* In short, the Props passed to a component are Read-Only.
* The concept of state allows React components to change their result as a response to changing user actions, network responses, etc. without violating this rule.

=== JavaScript

** Repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.
** Returns a positive integer (typically within the range of 1 to 2,147,483,647) that uniquely identifies the interval timer created by the call
